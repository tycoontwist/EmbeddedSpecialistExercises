# Exercise: Yocto build system and Git

## Instructions
1. Using resources available online, compile a bootable image for a RaspberryPi board using yocto.
    * You can use any image, minimal is correct
    * You're free to select a version of Yocto
    * You're free to select a version of the target RaspberryPi board
1. Add a new layer that:
    * contains a recipe to compile the bootgen tool from Xilinx for the target RaspberryPi
        * You can use tag 2019.2
    * adds bootgen to the firmware image image.
1. Provide a README in markdown format to describe steps to recompile your new image
    * Objective is that someone that follows the README can rebuild the image with no error

## Deliverables

Use public Git repositories (Github, Gitlab, etc.) to share the yocto layers.

# Solution
TODO CG: Update readme with steps to rebuild the image with no error.
