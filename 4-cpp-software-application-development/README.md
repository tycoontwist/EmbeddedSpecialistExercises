# Exercise: C++ Software application development

## Instructions
1. Provide a Dockerfile that will install all dependencies required to build and execute the program
1. Create the application (client and server) in C++
    * Usage of any open-source 3rd party library is allowed
1. Make the application build and run inside the container
1. Update the Dockerfile to download and install latest aarch64 toolchain from [bootlin](https://toolchains.bootlin.com/releases_aarch64.html)
1. Cross-compile the application for aarch64 using step 4.
1. Provide a README on how to reproduce from step 1. to step 5.
    * Provided in [solution](#solution).

## Deliverables

Use public Git repositories (Github, Gitlab, etc.) to share the source code.

Deliverables MUST build and run successfully based on README instructions (i.e no undocumented step required to make the deliverables run)

# Solution
TODO CG: Update readme with steps to rebuild the image with no error.

TODO CG:
* sudo sh -c 'apt update ; apt install -y build-essential'
